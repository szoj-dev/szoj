# SZOJ Contributing Guidelines

## How to contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check a [list of known issues](https://github.com/szoj-dev/szoj/labels/bug) to see if the problem has already been reported (or fixed in a master branch). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/szoj-dev/szoj/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include a **descriptive title, clear description, and a code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements (Feature Requests or RFCs)

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check a [list of known RFCs](https://github.com/szoj-dev/szoj/labels/rfc) to see if the feature has already been requested (or implemented in a master branch). If you're unable to find an open RFC addressing the feature, [open a new one](https://github.com/szoj-dev/szoj/issues/new/choose). Be sure to provide your reasoning for the feature.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.

2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.

3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation or state that the change needs to be documented (updated).

4. Ensure the test suite passes.

5. Make sure your code lints.

6. Issue that pull request!
